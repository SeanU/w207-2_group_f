    "Although the feature set appears small, there is quite a  bit of scope for feature engineering. In fact, we found with our experiments that the choice of ML algorithm matters less than the choice of features."

    "The dataset has the following variables:\n",
    "- AnimalID: unique identifier\n",
    "- Name: Missing in many cases; some animals are likely given names and others are not\n",
    "- DateTime:\tof the outcome\n",
    "- OutcomeType: The variable to be predicted; one of (Adoption, Died, Euthanasia, Transfer, Return to Owner)\n",
    "- OutcomeSubtype: Further information on the outcome. this field is not provided in the test dataset, so we will ignore it.\n",
    "- AnimalType: Cat or Dog\n",
    "- SexuponOutcome: Contains 2 pieces of information: Male/Female and Neutered/Spayed\n",
    "- AgeuponOutcome\n",
    "- Breed: This could be a mix of 2 breeds, a single breed, etc. There are over a thousand unique breed names and many many more combinations.\n",
    "- Color: Upto 2 colors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have experimented so far with binarizing the feature variables. With some it was quite straightforward (e.g. AnimalType, SexUponOutcome). For others like Breed, binarizing creates potentially thousands of new features and has the potential to overfit because of the sparseness of observations in each category. "

    "The process we are following is outlined below:\n",
    "- split the training data into a training and development set\n",
    "- train models on the training data subset; score on the development set\n",
    "- performing error analysis on the development prediction results\n",
    "- select a model based on best accuracy on training subset\n",

    "- get predictions for the test data and submit for Kaggle evaluation.\n",

    "For our intial submission we trained a logistic regression on a binarized feature set. This gave us an accuracy of about 0.66 on the dev data and an overall Kaggle score of 0.93. Subsequently we tried other algorithms (SVMs, Random Forest, AdaBoost) and also experimented with feature engineering. This gave us similar results for accuracy on the dev data but lower Kaggle scores than our intial submission. We concluded that Logistic Regression is probably the best algorithm for this dataset, and improvements can be made through further feature engineering."

    "- extract more information from the DateTime field - e.g. time of day, day of week, month, year, date etc. Some of these we have already tried.\n"
